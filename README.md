## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Cesar Archive is built with **Docker**. In order to start the web application, you must have installed:

### Installing

To start Cosmos Archive just type in the root directory of the project:

```
$ docker exec -i cesar-archive-db bash -c 'mysql -u root sample_database --password=tiger < /home/sample_database.sql'
```
